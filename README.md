# About this repo

This is my implementation of a basic compiler based on [Yankee42's implementation](https://github.com/yankee42/lets-build-a-compiler)

I adapt the grammar and visitors to implement new functions.

# Know Issues

- Recursive functions are not working properly yet. Currently working on a solution

# Next Steps

- Write a Main function in grammar

- Stop using ';' in 'if' and 'while'

- Write tests for multi dimensional vectors.
